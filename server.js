/* Explanation of the Changes
Initial Stock Price: We set the starting stock price at 150 as a baseline.
Drift and Volatility:
Drift (Î¼): This represents the general trend of the stock. We set a small positive drift (0.0002) to indicate slow growth.
Volatility (Ïƒ): This controls how much the price fluctuates. We set it to 0.01 for moderate fluctuations.
Random Shock (Z): This adds randomness to each price change, simulating market noise.
Stock Price Update Frequency: We're emitting data every 100 milliseconds to make the updates very fast.
How It Works
Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM): The formula creates a more natural price movement by combining a predictable trend (drift) with random fluctuations (volatility).
Realistic Data: The stock prices will appear more natural, with ups and downs, rather than just random values.
Adjusting the Parameters
You can tweak these parameters to simulate different types of stocks:

Drift (drift): Increase this value for more aggressive price trends (bullish market) or set it to a negative value for a declining trend (bearish market).
Volatility (volatility): Increase this to simulate highly volatile stocks or decrease it for more stable stocks.
Testing the Realistic Simulation
Chart Behavior: You should see the stock price moving more naturally on your chart, with slight upward or downward trends and occasional fluctuations.
Logging: You can log the emitted values to ensure they reflect realistic stock market behavior:
js
Copy code
console.log(`Emitting stock data: { timestamp: ${newTimestamp}, value: ${currentPrice} }`);
Summary
Realistic Simulation: We're using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to simulate stock prices, which is closer to how real financial markets behave.
Adjustable Parameters: You can tweak the drift and volatility to create different stock price scenarios.
Faster Updates: The data is now emitted more frequently, which will create a more dynamic visualization on the client side.
This approach should give you a more realistic and engaging simulation of stock price movements, 
making your data visualization more aligned with real-world scenarios. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with! ðŸ˜Š */
